# Overview

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}
I wrote a web app that stores data about characters and displays it. If you download my repository, you can run a live server using manage.py runserver. Click on the link it describes and add characters.

I wrote this software to familiarize myself with Django for an additional tool.

# Web Pages

- I built one page that shows a list of characters. Each character can be selected to go to a details page that dynamically generates the details using stored data.

# Development Environment

-I used Django in Visual Studio Code with the Python language.

# Future Work

* I need to build up my database more.
* I would love to have additional elements such as images.
